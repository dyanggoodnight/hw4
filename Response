What I learned: 
- Uploading examples in the system is sending the command to the Arduino board, the computer gives arduino board power to 
  runing all the command.
- You can change the speed of the LED blinking by changing the parameter in the example codes.
- The resistor is the key of change the brightness of an LED.
- The right connection of the positive and a negative lead is really important.

Question:
- why the lead is always connect 5V and GND? 
- what if the I connect of 5V and GND reverse?
